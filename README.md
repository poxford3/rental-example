# Intent

This project is a proof of concept from an [inspiration website](https://dribbble.com/shots/19358031-Lainappi-App-Rental-Service-for-sharing-items), the end product won't work as a functioning app but it will serve as a production of a visual, an image is found within [the assets](/assets/insp.png).

### Screenshots of app:

[screenshot1]: /assets/screenshot1.png "First View"
[screenshot2]: /assets/screenshot2.png "Scrolled Down"

Once loaded:

<!-- ![first entry into app picture][screenshot1] -->
<img src="/assets/screenshot1.png" alt="First View" height=200>

Scrolled down:

<!-- ![scrolled view in app picture][screenshot2] -->
<img src="/assets/screenshot2.png" alt="Scrolled Down" height=200>
